\par
5.3 Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration.

\par
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH GREATARCADEHITS AND ITS RELATED COMPANIES AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. Any claim or dispute between you and GreatArcadeHits or its Related Companies arising out of or relating in any way to the Site, Software, these Terms and Conditions, marketing by GreatArcadeHits or Third Party Content, including claims that arise after the termination of these Terms and Conditions, shall be resolved through final, binding arbitration. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. The obligation to arbitrate applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a tort, fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal or equitable theory.\par
\par
We each agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT. All arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions specifically prohibit you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person.\par
\par
A party who intends to proceed with a claim or dispute must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\ldblquote Notice\rdblquote ) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and setting forth the specific relief sought. All Notices to GreatArcadeHits shall be sent via email to legal@greatarcadehits.com and by United States mail to: GreatArcadeHits, 3419 Via Lido #261, Newport Beach, CA 92663, Attn: Legal Department. GreatArcadeHits will send notice to you via email to the email address we have on file for you, if any, or otherwise via a reasonable method. Upon receipt of such Notice, the other party shall have a thirty-day (30) period in which it may satisfy the claim against it by fully curing the dispute and/or providing all the relief requested in the Notice. After the expiration of such thirty-day (30) cure period, you or GreatArcadeHits may commence an arbitration proceeding if the claim has not been fully satisfied.\par
\par
The arbitration of any claim or dispute under these Terms and Conditions shall be conducted by one arbitrator exclusively in Orange County, California, and state or federal courts located in Orange County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over any appeals of or motions regarding an arbitration award. The arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would be available in court, except that the arbitrator may not issue relief on behalf of a class or otherwise issue class-wide or group relief. You acknowledge and agree that each party shall pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts, witnesses, and filing fees and the parties shall split the cost of the arbitrator.\par
\par
If any aspect or portion of this Section 5.3 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that aspect or portion will be severed with the remainder of Section 5.3 remaining in full force and effect.\par
\par
5.4 Jurisdiction and Venue. You and GreatArcadeHits agree that, as provided in Section 5.3, disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration. You and GreatArcadeHits also agree that if you or GreatArcadeHits should nonetheless file a lawsuit against the other or GreatArcadeHits\rquote s Related Companies, and regardless of the validity of the suit or whether it can be maintained or is prohibited by Section 5.3, the sole and exclusive forum, jurisdiction, and venue for such lawsuit shall be in courts of competent jurisdiction located in Orange County, California, and you hereby submit to and irrevocably waive all objections to such jurisdiction, forum, and venue.\par
\par
5.5 Choice of Law. These Terms and Conditions will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, irrespective of any principles of conflicts of law, and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \'a7 1 et seq.\par
\par
5.6 Entire Agreement. These Terms and Conditions, in connection with the other user obligations and rules detailed in writing on the Site, constitute the entire agreement between you and GreatArcadeHits with respect to your use and access to the Site and Software, and can only be modified by GreatArcadeHits as set forth above with respect to Amendments.\par
\par
5.7 Severability. If any portion of these Terms and Conditions is deemed void or unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and Conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.\par
